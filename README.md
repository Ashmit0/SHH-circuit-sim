# SHH-circuit-simulation

Problem: 

We wish to simulate the Su-Schriffer-Heeger (SSH) circuit model, which is developed for the practical realisation of the 'midgap' states in polyacetylene.

Procedure: 
1. A python script created the required ltspice netlist code, with user defined length and 't' value. 
2. There are two more python scripts for the process automation, which finally gives us a bunch of .csv files. 
3. for detiled analysis, please open the 'analysis_and_results.ipynb' jupyter file in the 'results' folder.
